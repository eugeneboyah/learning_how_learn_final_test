Speed Reading 
the speed reading came when Scot Young initially believed he could  increase his reading speed using special methods to the extant that he even to have doubled it in an article. However, he come to realize this isn't entirely accurate. While some suggest incredibly high reading speeds, like 20,000 words per minute, it's not realistically achievable due to the limitations of our eyes and brains. When we read, our eyes pause at words (fixation), move to the next (Saccade), and our brains process it all. This process can't happen too fast like this. Although some experts came up to say you can read faster by seeing more words simultaneously , our eyes and brains can only handle a limited amount of information at once. So, trying to read too fast may result in missing understanding. Certain apps propose that you can read quickly by displaying one word at a time (spritz). Yet, even this has its limits because our brains need time to comprehend words, and excessively fast display can be challenging for the eyes. So, the question was, can you improve your reading speed? and that was Yes, but not to a superhuman extent. Even reading at a regular pace is valuable. 

Here are some tips to improve you reading:
Quickly skim the text before you begin to enhance understanding.

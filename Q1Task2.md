My Strategy develop for this internship will be Focused Practice and Reflective Learning 
looking more at the focus and diffuse mode

Actively engage with the material I am learning. I won't just passively read or listen but because I want to secceed and my everyday Zurich life, I will participate in activities, discussions, or hands-on practice. Regularly reflect on my learning progress and assess my understanding of Go and Dart.

because  i resently I have realize that active learning reinforce my understandin and help me retain information and problem-solving skills. I tell you for free, I noticed that Self-reflection also help me track my development, recognize areas I need to improve, and refine my learning.

Maybe I can also add Continuous Self-Assessment
